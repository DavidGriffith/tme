The Machine Emulator, or tme, provides a general-purpose framework for 
computer emulation. The goal is to create a large library of modules, 
each emulating a specific computer chip, or bus, or board, etc. These 
modules offer standard interfaces that allow you to connect them 
together to create a whole machine emulation with a minimum of effort.

While these assembled machine emulations will likely never be as fast as 
a single program designed from the beginning to emulate a specific 
machine, the standard module interfaces should be reasonably fast. Even 
though the best abstract interfaces still introduce overhead and can't 
always express certain optimization hints, reusability will always save 
a lot of development time, and performance problems can be addressed by 
faster hardware.
