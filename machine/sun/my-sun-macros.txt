## my-sun-macros.txt - keyboard macros for generating
## keysyms found on Sun keyboards that probably aren't
## on your keyboard.  You are encouraged to edit this
## file to match your keyboard and preferences.

# these macros generate L1 through L10:
Control_R F1 = L1
Control_R F2 = L2
Control_R F3 = L3
Control_R F4 = L4
Control_R F5 = L5
Control_R F6 = L6
Control_R F7 = L7
Control_R F8 = L8
Control_R F9 = L9
Control_R F10 = L10
